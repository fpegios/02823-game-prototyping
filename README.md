# 02823 Introduction to Computer Game Prototyping

## Story
You've just been enrolled to your dream university. The engineering degree you've always dreamt of, is just around the corner. What you haven't realised as a freshman, is that exams doent pass themselves. A lot of hard work, temptations and pitfalls await ahead of you. Your goal is to take the high road for five full years, passing your exams thus collecting enough ECTS-points to that engineering degree you want.

## Concept

The game is a 2D platformer with a student as the main character. The student needs to avoid obstacles, passing each semester in order to graduate. Levels are different difficulties a student meets during his university life.
